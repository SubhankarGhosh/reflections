When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  For collaborating on projects as well as when I'm working on a machine other than my laptop.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If I am working on a feature which is not already synchronized then automatic pull might jeopardize my progress.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork is used to create a copy of a repository already existing online to our own account. 
	Clone is used to make a copy of a pre-existing local or online repository to our local system.
	Branches refer to a new line of flow within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	We can update the master and then push the changes back to the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	RAR files. It's tedious.
